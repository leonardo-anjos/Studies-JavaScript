### js: what the heck is a callback??

**what is a callback?**
a callback is a function that is to be executed ***afeter*** another function has finished executing

functions how this are called higher-order functions and any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function


**why di we need callbacks?**
for a one very important reason - js is an event driven language

callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesn't execute until other code has already fineshed execution
